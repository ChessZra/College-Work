Reflection: 
This project was fun. I spent more time analyzing the code, reflecting on possible optimizations, and trial and error approaches, and
seeing what worked more than the changes I made for the final code. Some optimizations were really straightforward. For example, in Collide ()
and bounceBackStream(), each iteration was independent so parallelizing them is straightforward. I encountered a bug / data-race for stream()
when I tried to do the same approach, parallelizing it was tricky and would involve multiple copies of data which I decided to be not worth it. Instead, I optimized it by reducing four different loops to just a single loop. 

I spent a couple of hours trying a specific approach in which I refactored the code from having many different pointers that store the directions to 
a struct that holds an array of size 9 which contains all the directions. That means I had to change pretty much the entire code.
I thought that this would improve cache hits but it was slower at the end of the day - so I decided not to use it.

Making the graph was pretty fun and a bit inconsistent at times - suspicion is the CS455 machine causing it. Overall, results
still made sense and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.
