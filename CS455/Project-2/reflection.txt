I found this project tricky for the most part. There are many places in the code which
could be causing instability like out-of-bound errors, wrong ghost rows, wrong barriers, etc.
In my experience, I struggled the most with instability happening on the barriers where the processes
get divided. To debug, I tried isolating every single function and I performed a lot of tests. I 
narrowed down the problem to either InitBarrier() or BounceBackStream() which I fixed eventually.

The MPI approach seems slightly faster than the OpenMP version in Project 1. Some possible
optimizations in the future would be incorporating a hybrid project (OpenMP and MPI.h).

Overall, this project was a bit hard but I learned a lot from the obstacles I faced.
