https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap
Programming language books explain that value types are created on the stack, and reference types are created on the heap, without explaining what these two things are. I haven't read a clear explanation of this.  I understand what a stack is. But, Where and what are they (physically in a real computer's memory)?To what extent are they controlled by the OS or language run-time?What is their scope?What determines the size of each of them?What makes one faster?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/477816/what-is-the-correct-json-content-type
I've been messing around with JSON for some time, just pushing it out as text and it hasn't hurt anybody (that I know of), but I'd like to start doing things properly.I have seen so many purported "standards" for the JSON content type:application/jsonapplication/x-javascripttext/javascripttext/x-javascripttext/x-jsonBut which one is correct, or best? I gather that there are security and browser support issues varying between them.I know there's a similar question, What MIME type if JSON is being returned by a REST API?, but I'd like a slightly more targeted answer.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/231767/what-does-the-yield-keyword-do
What is the use of the yield keyword in Python, and what does it do?For example, I'm trying to understand this code1:def _get_child_candidates(self, distance, min_dist, max_dist):    if self._leftchild and distance - max_dist < self._median:        yield self._leftchild    if self._rightchild and distance + max_dist >= self._median:        yield self._rightchild  And this is the caller:result, candidates = [], [self]while candidates:    node = candidates.pop()    distance = node._get_dist(obj)    if distance <= max_dist and distance >= min_dist:        result.extend(node._values)    candidates.extend(node._get_child_candidates(distance, min_dist, max_dist))return resultWhat happens when the method _get_child_candidates is called?Is a list returned? A single element? Is it called again? When will subsequent calls stop?1. This piece of code was written by Jochen Schulz (jrschulz), who made a great Python library for metric spaces.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1335851/what-does-use-strict-do-in-javascript-and-what-is-the-reasoning-behind-it
Recently, I ran some of my JavaScript code through Crockford's JSLint, and it gave the following error:  Problem at line 1 character 1: Missing "use strict" statement.Doing some searching, I realized that some people add "use strict"; into their JavaScript code. Once I added the statement, the error stopped appearing. Unfortunately, Google did not reveal much of the history behind this string statement. Certainly it must have something to do with how the JavaScript is interpreted by the browser, but I have no idea what the effect would be.So what is "use strict"; all about, what does it imply, and is it still relevant?Do any of the current browsers respond to the "use strict"; string or is it for future use?
