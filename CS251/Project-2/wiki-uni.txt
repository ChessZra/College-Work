Although UMM officially opened its doors in 1960, the history of what became the current institution reaches to 1887. That year, the first building of the Morris Industrial School for Indians, an American Indian boarding school, was constructed on the site and run by the Roman Catholic Sisters of Mercy under contract to the US government. Beginning in 1898, the Office of Indian Affairs (today's Bureau of Indian Affairs) took over operations to introduce a more progressive curriculum.[11][12] The school closed in 1909, under a congressionally authorized program to reduce the number of boarding schools in preference for locating schools on reservations, so that families and communities would not be broken up. The campus was transferred to the State of Minnesota under the agreement that American Indians would always be admitted free of tuition; the current UMM still follows this policy.[13]

Salisbury wrote of a unique tradition of the school known as "Students' Day." One day during the term faculty would, unannounced, be entirely absent from the school. Once students recognized that the day must be "Students' Day", they would elect a President and Faculty from amongst themselves who would take up the regular duties of the day. The annual catalogue stated the purpose of "Students' Day" as the following: "The object of thus putting the institution under the care of the students is to test their moral culture, their executive ability, and their devotion to their work."[4]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_State_University
The institution was founded in 1971 as Minnesota Metropolitan State College with a mission to educate non-traditional students from the Twin Cities metropolitan area whose needs were not served by other existing institutions like the University of Minnesota.[6] David E. Sweet was appointed the university's first president[7] and the school, with offices above a drug store in downtown St. Paul, admitted the first class of 50 students in 1972.  The university did not have a campus and offered classes in rented space throughout the Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St. Paul) metropolitan area. When Metropolitan State began, it was a college for working adults. It was strictly an upper-division college where students could only complete their junior and senior years of academic study.[8] The university initially followed a non-traditional course: it offered competence-based learning whereby students were recognized for learning gained outside the classroom—including prior learning through experience. Letter grades were available, but they were always optional. Instead of mandatory letter grades instructors wrote 'narrative evaluations' and recorded only what students "knew and could do." Students designed their own degree plans. Most of the teaching was done by 'community faculty' who held advanced degrees and had extensive practical experience in their respective fields.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_University
The origins of Ottawa University date back to the 1860s when Baptist missionaries established the First Baptist Church in the area that would eventually develop into Ottawa, which at the time was occupied by Native Americans. Elsewhere, Kansas Baptists had managed to charter an institute of higher learning that they were planning on calling the "Roger Williams University". In the early 1860s, they were looking for a place to establish it and at the 1860 Baptist State Convention in Atchison, Kansas, Rev. John Tecumseh "Tauy" Jones made a case for the university coming to Ottawa; he proposed that the Baptists work with the Native Americans in the area, who had land that they might be willing to sell for the purpose of creating a college. After discussions with the Native Americans—who were amenable to the idea—it was agreed that 20,000 acres of land would be set aside for the express purpose of constructing a college. On August 20, 1862, the first board of trustees (made up of four Native Americans and two white Baptists) met and decided to purchase 5,000 acres of the aforementioned land so as to establish a campus. In 1865, the name "Roger Williams University" was decommissioned in favor of "Ottawa University". Eventually, the campus was whittled down to about 640 acres.[3]

Wisconsin's technical colleges were founded to train the work force. In the early 1900s, most workers in Wisconsin received their education through the apprenticeship system - both job skills and academic skills.[citation needed] In order to standardize the education that these working young adults received in reading, writing, and math, the state of Wisconsin promoted the creation of city vocational schools. Schools sprang up in Green Bay and Marinette in 1912, followed in 1941 by a school in Sturgeon Bay. Their scope expanded to include adults of all ages who were interested in technical careers, whether in the work force or not. In 1968, the three schools merged to become a single district in the Wisconsin Technical College System, serving part or all of nine counties under the name Northeast Wisconsin Technical Institute.  This name was changed in the late 1980s to Northeast Wisconsin Technical College.[1][2]

St. Cloud State opened its doors to students in 1869, under the name Third State Normal School. The school was one building, the Stearns House, a renovated hotel purchased by the state Legislature for $3,000.[9] Classrooms were on the first floor, the model school was on the second floor and a women's dormitory was housed on the third floor.  The five-member faculty was headed by Principal Ira Moore. Of the 53 original students, 43 were women. As the number of female students increased, Stearns House was completely transformed into a women's dormitory in 1874; male students organized a boarding club where they located a house near campus, overseen by a matron.[9]
