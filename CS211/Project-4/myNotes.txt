For the president to win, the president needs to receive 270 or more electoral votes.

Each state has different number of electoral votes.

To win all the electoral votes per state, it needs to receive the 
vote amount: (popularVotes // 2 + 1)


What's the minimum number of (popular) votes needed to win?

Brute Force Solution:
Given 50 states:
    Find all subsets of the states:
        // for every state, the electoral votes that count is only popularVotes // 2 + 1 (because we are finding the min)
        For each subset, if the the sum of electoral votes of all states in that subset is >= 270:
            answer = min(answer, electoral_votes);
